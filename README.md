# COMP 550 Final Project - Sentiment Analysis on App Reviews 
### The goal of this project is to explore sentiment analysis by transformers in greater depth than is covered by lectures + homework

This study explored the application of the Transformer model in sentiment analysis for application reviews. We devised and implemented a Transformer-based model, subsequently comparing its outcomes with those of LSTM, CNN, and Na√Øve Bayes models using
publicly available application review dataset.
Our findings reveal that the optimal model for
sentiment analysis for application reviews is
contingent upon computational resources, train011 ing time constraints, and the diversity of labels
within the dataset.
